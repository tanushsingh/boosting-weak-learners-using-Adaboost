# boosting-weak-learners-using-Adaboost

Creating weak learning decision stumps which provide splits that are evaluated based on Gini index. These weak learners have been boosted using Adaboost. 

Applying this to the MNIST dataset of handwritten digist. This is an encoding of the problem of recognizing handwritten digits, specialized to distinguishing between the digits 3 and 5 (this is the NIST dataset originally collected by Yann LeCun). 
The first column in the training dataset is the label, and each feature that follows is a pixel encoding.
